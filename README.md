# Othello MVC API Application
This is a backend-driven web application for a multiplayer Othello (Reversi) game built using ASP.NET Core MVC. The application consists of a REST API and an MVC client. The frontend is planned to be developed in vanilla JavaScript, and the current implementation handles all logic via the API and server-side code.

## Project Overview
The Othello MVC API project is designed to handle multiplayer Othello gameplay through a robust backend architecture. The application provides essential features for managing players, game sessions, and results. The REST API offers a suite of endpoints to facilitate game creation, player interaction, and game results tracking, while the MVC structure allows seamless interaction between the API and the client application.

# Features
- User Authentication: Players register and log in through the MVC application using ASP.NET Identity.  
- Game Management: Players can create new Othello games or join existing ones.  
- Game Progress Locking: Players in an ongoing game are redirected to the game page and cannot leave until the game is finished.  
- Real-time Game Updates (Planned): Vanilla JavaScript with AJAX will be used to periodically update the game state.  
- Friend System: Players can send and accept friend requests and invite friends to join games.  
- Result Tracking: Match results, including wins, losses, and draws, are stored in the database and can be viewed via the playerâ€™s profile.  

# Technologies
- ASP.NET Core MVC: For the web framework and MVC client.
- Entity Framework Core: Used for data access and database management.
- ASP.NET Identity: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- MS SQL Server: The database system for storing game, player, and result data.
- REST API: The backend API handles game logic, player data, and real-time game updates.
- Vanilla JavaScript (Planned): For handling client-side interactions and real-time updates.

# API Structure
The API handles game logic, player management, and game results. It interacts with the database via Entity Framework Core and includes various layers for repository management.

## Controllers
1. GameController:
    - Manages game creation, joining, and gameplay.
    - Endpoints include:
        - POST /api/game/create: Create a new game.
        - POST /api/game/join: Join an existing game.
        - PUT /api/game/move: Submit a move.
        - POST /api/game/delete: Delete a pending game.
        - GET /api/game/{token}: Retrieve game details.
2. PlayerController:
    - Handles player registration, login, and friend requests.
    - Endpoints include:
        - POST /api/player/create: Register a new player.
        - POST /api/player/login: Log in an existing player.
        - POST /api/player/friend/send: Send a friend request.
        - POST /api/player/friend/accept: Accept a friend request.

3. ResultController:
    - Manages game results and provides statistics.
    - Endpoints include:
        - GET /api/result/{playerId}: Retrieve match history.
        - GET /api/result/stats/{playerId}: Retrieve player statistics.
  
# Database Access Layer
The application uses a repository pattern to manage data. The following repositories interact with the database:
- GameAccessLayer: Manages game-related data.
- PlayerAccessLayer: Manages player data.
- ResultAccessLayer: Handles game results and statistics.
- Repository: Implements IRepository to combine game, player, and result repository logic.

Interfaces include: IGameRepository, IPlayerRepository, IResultRepository, and IRepository for abstracting database interactions.

# MVC Structure
The MVC side of the project is responsible for rendering views and handling user interactions. It communicates with the API for all game-related actions.

# MVC Controllers
1. GameController:
    - Manages game-related interactions like creating, joining, and playing games.
    - Includes logic to fetch game status from the API and update the views accordingly.

2. HomeController:
    - Responsible for the home page where players can view games, pending games, and player statistics.
    - Automatically redirects players in an active game to the game page.

3. ProfileController:
    - Displays player profiles, including match history, friends, and friend requests.

4. GameInProgressMiddleware & GameInProgressFilter:
    - Middleware to automatically redirect players to their ongoing game if they attempt to navigate to other parts of the app while a game is in progress.

# Game Flow
1. Login/Register: Players log in or register using ASP.NET Identity.
2. Game State Check: After login, the system checks if the player is already in a game. If they are, they are redirected to the game page.
3. Create/Join Game: Players can create a new game or join a pending game.
4. Gameplay: The game board is updated in real-time using AJAX (or SignalR in the future).
5. Game Completion: Once the game is over, players are free to start or join another game.

# Planned Frontend
The frontend will be developed using vanilla JavaScript. Features like real-time updates, game state polling, and user interactions will be handled with AJAX requests.

## Planned Features
- AJAX Polling: Check the game state periodically to update the game board in real-time.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Used for UI interactivity, including showing move options, handling game state changes, and responding to player actions.
- Responsive Design: Ensure that the game and all other pages are responsive across devices.

#Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    - git clone https://github.com/your-repository/othello-game.git
    - cd othello-game

2. Setup the database:
    - Ensure SQL Server is running.
    - Update the connection string in appsettings.json.
    - Run migrations to create the database schema:
         - dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
         - dotnet ef database update
  
3. Run the application:
    - Run both the MVC and API projects via Visual Studio or CLI:
         - dotnet run

4. Access the app:
    - Go to https://localhost:{port} to start the game.

# Future Enhancements
1. SignalR Integration: Real-time updates via SignalR to avoid polling.
2. Frontend Development: Develop a rich user interface using vanilla JavaScript and possibly transition to a modern frontend framework (React/Angular) later.
3. Player Statistics: Show more detailed player statistics such as move efficiency, longest winning streak, etc.
4. AI Opponent: Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.

# Conclusion
This Othello MVC and API application provides a backend foundation for building a fully-featured multiplayer game with real-time updates, player management, and friend-based interactions. The project is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for future enhancements and frontend development using vanilla JavaScript or any modern framework.
